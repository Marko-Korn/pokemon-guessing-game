# pokemon-guessing-game
A Python based Pokemon guessing game, made using mainly Tkinter and Beautiful Soup.

# Features
Using requests and Beautiful Soup, all the Pokemon names, types and images get scraped from https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/national and saved into a CSV file. A random Pokemon is chosen every time the random button is pressed and the user can afterwards try and guess the Pokemon's name.
